![Golden Compass: An Elegant Full-Stack Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yinanfang/GoldenCompass/master/Others/images/logo_github.png)

An elegant full-stack project with Node.js backend, HTML5 website and iOS app

## Progress
- [ ] iOS app
- [ ] Node backend
- [ ] HTML5 website

## Requirements
- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 6.3+
- Node 0.11.2+

## Quick Installation

    git clone https://github.com/yinanfang/GoldenCompass; cd GoldenCompass
    cd node; npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install; cd ..
    cd iOS; cocoapod install; cd ..

    Create $HOME/node/config/config.js and fill in info like $HOME/Others/configTemplate.js

## iOS Features:

#### Extensive Use of Third-Party Libraries
- Core for all
  - ReactiveCocoa
  - CocoaLumberjack
  - libextobjc
- Animation
  - pop
- Model
  - Mantle
- Networking
  - AFNetworking
- Routing
  - JLRoutes

#### Multi-Threaded Programming
Only update UI from the main thread. Do other work in the secondary thread

- Queue
  - Default Main Queue
  - Default Background Queue
  - Data Layer Queue

#### Dependencies Injection with NSNotification+Factory Methods

#### Core-Data?

#### Architecture Decision
- [VIPER](http://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/)
  - After Comparing the [difference](http://khanlou.com/2014/03/model-view-whatever/) between MVC, MVVM, and VIPER, I chose to use VIPER because of its scalability.

### Node.js

#### Architecture

#### Icon

#### Build System

node
1. Use development tools that automatesrestarts and browser refresh
  * nodemon for dev and pm2 for production
2. Non-blocking event loop
3. Use promises
  * Async
4. Strong in modularity
5. Advance logging
  * With Bunyan: https://strongloop.com/strongblog/compare-node-js-logging-winston-bunyan/
6. Test coverage ??
7. Utilyze static analysis tools
  * ESLint
8. Monitor and profile for production
9. Advanced debuging with https://github.com/visionmedia/debug
10. Statistics
  * https://github.com/etsy/statsd   ??
11. Password Security
  * BCrypt

Dependencies:
  AngularJS

node plugins
  ejs
  express-session
  dcodeIO/bcrypt.js
  expressjs/cors
  hokaccha/node-jwt-simple
  node-csv
  PapaParse

generator
  node - express; koa (TODO)
  browser - bluebird, tracer-compiler
  both - async

EC6
  traceur-compiler

Facebook/Flux
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&t=602&v=nYkdrAPrdcw
  MVC doesn't scale
    MVC is pretty good for small application. Everything has its particular roll to play. The problem is that it doesn't make room for the new features
  Increase predictability
  MVC allows bi-direction data flow, but Flux allows only one direction data flow

Facebook/React
  When data changes, React re-renders the component
  Referentially transparent functions
    Describe UI at any point in time
    Trivial to predict for a given input
    Easy to test
  React builds a new virtual DOM subtree
    diffs it with the old one
    computes the minimal set of DOM mutations and puts them in a queue
    and batch executes all updates

Might worries about the performance if only a small changes occurs in a huge DOM tree. There're a lot of useless diffs
  To understand: How to improve this kind of performance hit

### Github badges https://github.com/badges/shields

### Uses markdown editor here
https://stackedit.io/editor
### Folder structure follow "polymer-starter-kit".
  * Same from Yeoman maybe. Add .htaccess at the root level "app": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKiaLSJW5xI

### Use this as a main repo. Add submodule for the node and iOS parts??

### gitignore
Add "// .gitignore node_modules/*" and add setup command such as "npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install" in "https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit"

### Follow 10 key points: https://www.airpair.com/node.js/posts/top-10-mistakes-node-developers-make
### This too: https://medium.com/@faisalabid/7-tips-for-a-node-js-padawan-e7c0b0e5ce3c


### Debug
